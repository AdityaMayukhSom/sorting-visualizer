# Sorting Visualizer

A web application with which you can visualize the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

## Implemented algorithms:

    1. Bubble Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Merge Sort
    5. Quick Sort
    6. Heap Sort

    Currently these 3 sorting algorithms are not implemented, but I will implement them in near future.

    7. Radix Sort
    8. Counting Sort
    9. Bucket Sort

## Features:

**_1. Color Code_**

-   Sky Blue: Default colour
-   Orange: Being compared
-   Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
-   Green: In correct position

**_2. Specialities_**

-   Ability to control the speed of visualization
-   Ability to change the array size
-   Randomly generate new array
